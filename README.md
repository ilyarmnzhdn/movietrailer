# MovieTrailer
This is my first project using object-oriented Python, that I've made during Udacity Full Stack Web Development Nanodegree.
In this project I've used "webbrowser, os, re" libraries. 
# Quick Start
1. Install Python
2. Download or clone the repo: https://github.com/ilyarmnzhdn/movietrailer.git
3. Open entertainment_center.py file in IDLE (pyCharm etc.).
4. For Windows users press "f5" if you are using OS X press "fn + f5"
